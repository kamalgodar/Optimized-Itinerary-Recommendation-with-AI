Basically, we'll be solving the optimization problem when we find the best routes with minimum cost and best rewards (rewards to be implemented after the cost system is done and dusted) . This optimization problem is termed as 'orienteering problem', a close variant of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Also, to be noted that when orienteering problem attempts to visit every nodes in the graph, it becomes identical to the TSP.

TSP is a NP-hard problem . In the simplest sense, it means that the problem can't find the exact optimal solution in the polynomial time. But, there are different techniques and heuristics to solve it and apply in our real world problems to a good measure of satisfaction. 

In our case, we'll implement the route optimization problem in 3 of the ways:

1. Greedy approach : Nearest Neighbor Heuristic followed by 2-opt
2. DP approach : Dynamic Programming 
3. Ant-colony optimization : our preferred way to optimize routes using the technique of ant-colony optimization 

There are several other ways too like Genetic algorithm :Simulated Annealing, Branch-and-bound technique, branch-and-cut technique, GRASP ,etc.
